            <p>
              The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to give parents control while kids enjoy
              family-friendly TV shows and movies in their own space.

              Kids profiles come with PIN-protected parental controls that let you restrict the maturity rating of
              content kids can watch and block specific titles you don’t want kids to see.
